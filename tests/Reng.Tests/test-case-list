DESC of DATA MODELING
Data Modeling
A traditional requirement of Process modeling is to be able to model the items (physical or information items) that are
created, manipulated, and used during the execution of a Process.
This requirement is realized in BPMN through various constructs: 
  - Data Objects
  - ItemDefinition
  - Properties
  - Data Inputs
  - Data Outputs
  - Messages
  - Input Sets
  - Output Sets
  - Data Associations.
